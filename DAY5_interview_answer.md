# Interview Explanation (Linux Experience)

I have hands-on experience setting up and operating a Linux-based development and operating a Linux-based development
and execution enviroment.

Speciffically, I prepared an Ubuntu enviroment on Raspberry Pi as an execution platform and used apt to manage system-level dependencies.
To avoid Python dependency conflicts, I used venv and managed packages per project.

All configuration and documentation were managed with Git and GitHub, and I mainly worked throgh the command line using vim.

This setup allowed me to maintain a stable enviroment suitable for ROS2 and hardware-connected applications.
